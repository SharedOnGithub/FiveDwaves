The algorithm is trivial to implement in any language. Python and its standard 
libraries were used though to make it easier for anyone to read. Some basic 
tests were included. However, comprehensive tests were intentionally omitted 
to preserve simplicity. PyDev project was included so that anyone can use an
IDE even though other IDEs or editors may be more popular. Similarly AGPL was
chosen to avoid abuses.

    Five Dwarves (Gimli Fili Ilif Ilmig and Mark) met at the Prancing Pony 
    and played a word game to determine which combinations of their names 
    resulted in a palindrome.  Write a program in that prints out all of those 
    combinations.
